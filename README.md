# Name-Place-Animal-Thing
This is a small python project, made during the hackathon conducted in pcce-goa in which I won 1st place.

In this I've made use of easygui module/library, to generate the ui. 
This project was made under the theme of "Education" which was given for the hackathon.
The purpose of this appplication was to act as a general knowledge enhancement tool for children going to primary schools.

It works in this way
The user sees a Famous personality, Location, Animal or Thing and the child has to name it. If correct this application will return correct and give more information about the displayed image, if wrong it will reply saying the answer is wrong and again give info about the displayed image, this process is meant to increase the child's general knowledge through a fun game. 


The learning.py file can be used to run the app.
